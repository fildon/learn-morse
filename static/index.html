        Learning Progress: A single card is considered 100% learned
        when you have a 7+ correct streak with it. The overall
        progress meter measures your progress towards that goal
        averaged over every card.

        If you current lesson is "morseToText" you can submit the
        answer by keyboard, instead of clicking the buttons. Marking
        is case-insensitive so don't worry about capitalization. If
        you press a key which doesn't correspond to a plausible
        answer, the input is ignored (e.g. the shift key).
